# Summary
A react app built to test and read about convolutional neural networks (MobileNet and ResNet) built to classify monkeypox images.
Pre trained models and relevant research do not belong to me.

# About the research conducted
Extensive research and experimentation on an open source dataset from Kaggle was conducted by <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohan-thorat-b1655a253/">Rohan Thorat</a> and Mr. Aditya Gupta of Manipal University Jaipur.

Code for model development is available <a href="https://github.com/rohanthorat27/Monkeypox-Detection" target = "_blank">here</a>
